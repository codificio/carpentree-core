# Core

This is where your description should go. Take a look at [contributing.md](contributing.md) to see a to do list.

## Installation

- Via Composer
``` bash
$ composer require carpentree/core
```
- **IMPORTANT!** Remove default Laravel migrations about users:
    - `yyyy_mm_dd_HHiiss_create_users_table.php`
    - `yyyy_mm_dd_HHiiss_create_password_resets_table.php`

- Run migrations
``` bash
$ php artisan migrate
```
- Since the package uses Laravel Passport, you need to install it
``` bash
$ php artisan passport:install
```
- In your `config/auth.php` configuration file, you should set the `driver` option of the `api` authentication guard to `passport`.
``` php
'guards' => [
    'api' => [
        'driver' => 'passport',
        'provider' => 'users',
    ],
],
```
- [Optional] If you want, remove default `User` model class in `App/User`.
- [Optional] If you want, remove no more useful Middleware and Controller. Remember this package aim to provide a _stateless_ application skeleton, so default `session` authentication will not be used.
- In your `config/auth.php` configuration file, you should set the `model` option of the `users` provider to the new User class.
``` php
'providers' => [
        'users' => [
            'driver' => 'eloquent',
            'model' => \Carpentree\Core\Models\User::class,
        ],
    ],
```

## Usage

### Authorization and authentication

#### Enable social authentication

Add credentials for the OAuth services your application utilizes. These credentials should be placed in your `config/services.php` configuration file, and should use the key equals to provider name (e.g., `facebook`, `google`, `github` etc.).

For example:

``` php
'google' => [
    'client_id' => env('GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID'),
    'client_secret' => env('GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET'),
    'redirect' => env('GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URL'),
],
```

> We will use Socialite just for retrieving user details from an access token so we can fill client_id, client_secret, redirect with **empty strings (not NULL)** because they wonâ€™t be used in our flow.

#### Roles and permissions

There is a `Super Admin` role who can do everything. To make sure you correctly pass the check on this role, you must use the native Laravel `@can` and `can()` directives.

It is generally best to code the app around `permissions` only. That way you can always use the native Laravel `@can` and `can()` directives everywhere in your app.

##### Middleware

Since this package base his roles and permissions system on `spatie\laravel-permission`, if you want to use middlewares, you need to add them inside your `app/Http/Kernel.php` file.

``` php
protected $routeMiddleware = [
    // ...
    'role' => \Spatie\Permission\Middlewares\RoleMiddleware::class,
    'permission' => \Spatie\Permission\Middlewares\PermissionMiddleware::class,
    'role_or_permission' => \Spatie\Permission\Middlewares\RoleOrPermissionMiddleware::class,
];
```

##### Manage permissions

- Add permissions you want to the `carpentree` config file, e.g:

``` php
'permissions' => [
    'users' => [
        'create',
        'read',
        'update',
        'delete',
        'manage-permissions'
    ],
    
    'group-key' => [
        'permission-key-1',
        'permission-key-2',
        // ...
    ]
]
```

- Update your database by running the console command:

``` bash
$ php artisan carpentree:refresh-permissions
```

> For consistency reasons, old permissions are not removed automatically by the command. You have to do manually. 

Permission final name will be `group-key.permission-key` adn you can refer to it from the code, for example, in this way:

``` php
$user->hasPermissionTo('users.delete');
```
